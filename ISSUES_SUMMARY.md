- **Quality**: 95%+ test coverage, automated quality gates
- **Operations**: Production-ready deployment, monitoring, backups
- **DX**: Comprehensive docs, automated setup, development tools

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create GitHub Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Use GITHUB_ISSUES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md to copy/paste issue titles
   # Add suggested labels and priority levels
   ```

2. **Set Up Project Board**:
   - Create 4 columns: Security, Features, Quality, Operations
   - Assign issues to team members
   - Set sprint milestones

3. **Begin Development**:
   - Start with Issues #1-3 (Security Foundation)
   - Follow the PROJECT_ROADMAP.md timeline
   - Use DEVELOPMENT_ISSUES.md for implementation details

### Development Guidelines
- **Small commits**: Each issue is 1-4 days of work
- **Independent tasks**: Issues can be worked on simultaneously
- **Quality first**: All changes require tests and documentation
- **Security focus**: Security issues have highest priority
