# Testing Documentation for SF5 Blog App

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy and implementation for the SF5 Blog Flutter application.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

#### Services Tests (`test/services/`)
- **AuthService Tests**: Authentication logic, state management, persistence
- **ApiService Tests**: HTTP requests, error handling, data parsing

#### Models Tests (`test/models_test.dart`)
- **Model Serialization**: JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Model Validation**: Data validation and constraints

### 2. Widget Tests
Widget tests verify UI components and their interactions:

#### Screen Tests (`test/screens/`)
- **LoginScreen Tests**: Form validation, authentication flow, navigation
- **BlogListScreen Tests**: List rendering, navigation, state management
- **BlogDetailScreen Tests**: Content display, comment interactions
- **CreatePostScreen Tests**: Form handling, submission, validation

#### Widget Tests (`test/widgets/`)
- **BlogPostCard Tests**: Content display, formatting, interactions
- **CommentCard Tests**: Comment rendering, user interactions

### 3. Integration Tests
Integration tests verify complete feature flows:

#### Authentication Flow (`integration_test/auth_flow_test.dart`)
- Complete login/registration journey
- Form validation and error handling
- State persistence and navigation

#### Blog Management Flow (`integration_test/blog_flow_test.dart`)
- Blog creation, editing, deletion
- Comment management
- Navigation between screens

### 4. Acceptance Tests (E2E)
End-to-end tests verify complete user journeys:

#### User Journeys (`test_driver/app_test.dart`)
- Registration to first blog post creation
- Login to blog browsing and commenting
- Error scenarios and recovery
- Performance and usability testing

## Dependencies

The following testing dependencies have been added to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  mockito: ^5.4.4              # Mocking framework
  mocktail: ^1.0.3             # Modern mocking alternative
  integration_test:             # Integration testing
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences_test: ^2.1.0  # SharedPreferences testing
```

## Running Tests

### Unit and Widget Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/auth_service_test.dart

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Acceptance Tests (E2E)
```bash
# Start the test driver
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for services and models
- **Widget Tests**: 80%+ coverage for all UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Cover all major user flows
- **E2E Tests**: Cover critical user journeys

## Mock Strategy

### Services Mocking
- Use `mockito` for HTTP client mocking in service tests
- Create mock implementations for widget tests
- Use `shared_preferences_test` for persistence testing

### Data Mocking
- Create realistic test data for consistent testing
- Use builders pattern for test data creation
- Mock API responses with realistic JSON structures

## Continuous Integration

Tests should be run in CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit**: Run unit and widget tests
2. **Pull Request**: Run all tests including integration tests
3. **Deploy**: Run full test suite including E2E tests

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests using `group()` function
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Test Data
- Use consistent test data across related tests
- Create data builders for complex objects
- Clean up test data between tests

### Assertions
- Use specific assertions rather than generic ones
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### Performance
- Keep unit tests fast (< 100ms each)
- Use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` for common initialization
- Mock expensive operations in unit tests

## Known Limitations

1. **Generated Files**: Tests depend on generated mock and serialization files (*.g.dart, *.mocks.dart) that require Flutter SDK to create. Stub versions are included for environments without Flutter SDK.
2. **API Dependencies**: Some integration tests require a running test API server
3. **Platform Differences**: E2E tests may behave differently on different platforms
4. **Network Simulation**: Limited ability to simulate specific network conditions
5. **Authentication**: Real authentication flows require valid test credentials

## Future Improvements

1. **Golden Tests**: Add visual regression testing for UI components
2. **Performance Tests**: Add automated performance benchmarking
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Enhance accessibility testing coverage
4. **Cross-platform Tests**: Expand testing across iOS and Android
5. **API Contract Tests**: Add contract testing with backend API

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout for slow operations
2. **Widget Not Found**: Ensure proper pump and settle timing
3. **Mock Setup**: Verify mock setup matches actual usage
4. **State Management**: Ensure proper provider setup in tests

### Debug Tips

1. Use `flutter test --verbose` for detailed output
2. Add debug prints in tests for troubleshooting
3. Use `tester.binding.debugDumpApp()` to inspect widget tree
4. Run single tests in isolation to identify issues

### Generated Files Setup

If tests fail due to missing generated files, run the following commands with Flutter SDK available:

```bash
# Generate mocks and JSON serialization files
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run tests after generation
flutter test
```

**Note**: Stub versions of generated files are committed to allow testing in environments without Flutter SDK, but for full functionality, proper generation is recommended.
