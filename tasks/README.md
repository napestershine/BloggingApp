# FastAPI-Flutter Blogging App Development Tasks

This directory contains a comprehensive list of tasks to transform the current Flutter blogging app into a successful, feature-rich blogging platform. **Tasks are now organized to prioritize FastAPI backend development** to support robust Flutter frontend functionality.

## Directory Structure

- **01-user-experience/** - User interface and experience improvements (Flutter + FastAPI endpoints)
- **02-content-management/** - Content creation and management features (FastAPI + Flutter UI)
- **03-social-features/** - Social interaction and community features (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **04-seo-discovery/** - Search engine optimization and content discovery (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **05-analytics-insights/** - Analytics, reporting, and insights (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **06-performance-security/** - Performance optimization and security (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **07-monetization/** - Revenue generation features (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **08-admin-features/** - Administrative and moderation tools (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **09-mobile-optimization/** - Mobile-specific optimizations (FastAPI + Flutter)
- **10-api-enhancements/** - Backend API improvements and new endpoints (FastAPI focus)

## Current FastAPI Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Endpoints (14/93+)
- **Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`
- **Users**: `GET /users/{id}`, `PUT /users/{id}`  
- **Blog Posts**: `GET /blog_posts/`, `POST /blog_posts/`, `GET /blog_posts/{id}`, `PUT /blog_posts/{id}`
- **Comments**: `GET /comments/`, `POST /comments/`, `GET /comments/{id}`, `PUT /comments/{id}`, `GET /comments/blog_post/{id}`
- **Health**: `GET /`, `GET /health`

### üöß Priority Development Order for FastAPI Backend

1. **P0 (Critical) - Foundation APIs**: Missing 20+ endpoints for basic functionality
2. **P1 (High) - Core Features**: Missing 35+ endpoints for user engagement  
3. **P2 (Medium) - Advanced Features**: Missing 25+ endpoints for scaling
4. **P3 (Low) - Enhancement APIs**: Missing 10+ endpoints for optimization

## FastAPI Development Workflow

Each task now includes:
- **FastAPI Endpoint Requirements**: Specific API endpoints needed
- **Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Done, üöß In Progress, ‚ùå Not Started
- **Flutter Integration Notes**: How the API supports Flutter frontend
- **Testing Requirements**: API and integration test specifications
- **Priority Level**: Based on backend-first development approach

## Quick Stats

Total Tasks: 50+
Categories: 10
Missing API Endpoints: 25+

## Getting Started

### For FastAPI Backend Development
1. Review missing API endpoints in `missing-api-endpoints.md`
2. Implement endpoints in priority order (P0 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)  
3. Test each API endpoint using `/docs` (Swagger UI)
4. Ensure proper error handling and validation
5. Add corresponding tests in `python/app/tests/`

### For Flutter Frontend Development
1. Check which FastAPI endpoints are available (‚úÖ status)
2. Implement Flutter screens that use existing APIs first
3. Mock or stub missing APIs for UI development
4. Integrate with real APIs as backend endpoints become available
5. Test Flutter app against FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000`

### Development Priority
**Backend-First Approach**: Prioritize FastAPI endpoint implementation before Flutter features to ensure robust API foundation for mobile development.
