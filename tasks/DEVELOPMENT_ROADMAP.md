**Deliverable**: Monetizable platform ready for market launch

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Backend-First Development Approach
1. **API Development Priority**: Implement FastAPI endpoints before Flutter features
2. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive API testing before UI integration
3. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation in Swagger
4. **Version Control**: Feature branches for API endpoints, integration branches for Flutter
5. **Deployment**: Staged deployment with backend first, then frontend integration

## Technical Implementation

### FastAPI Endpoint Implementation Status

**Current**: 14 implemented endpoints
**Phase 1 Target**: 32 endpoints (18 new)
**Phase 2 Target**: 55 endpoints (23 new)  
**Phase 3 Target**: 78 endpoints (23 new)
**Phase 4 Target**: 93+ endpoints (15+ new)

#### Critical Missing Endpoints (Phase 1)
- Authentication: email verification, password reset, token refresh
- Content: delete operations, media upload, basic search
- Users: profile management, avatar upload
- Social: basic likes and follows

#### High Priority Endpoints (Phase 2)
- Search: advanced search with filters
- Social: notifications, bookmarks, comment reactions
- Content: categories, tags, trending posts
- Discovery: related posts, personalized feeds

### Technology Stack (Updated)

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) â†’ PostgreSQL (production)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation**: Pydantic models
- **Testing**: pytest with TestClient
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI + ReDoc

#### Frontend  
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **State Management**: Provider/Bloc/Riverpod (to be decided)
- **HTTP Client**: http/dio package
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences/Hive
- **Authentication**: JWT token management
- **Testing**: flutter_test + integration_test

#### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Local SQLite + FastAPI dev server
- **Staging**: Docker containers with PostgreSQL
- **Production**: Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring
- **Documentation**: Automated API docs + Flutter documentation
